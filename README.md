# TicTacToe

This is me making a tictactoe game and learning git

## Objectives
1. make a simple 2 player TicTacToe game
2. add a bot functionality
3. you could switch between 2 player and bot mode
4. add MinMax algorithm to the bot (maybe make the algorithm in c++???)

## Fixes or improvements
- Putting every graphic element in show function
- Making order into the messy code
- Fixing the grid cordinates system so I don't have to reverse the tuples (maybe???)

## Next step
- making the bot actually do something
- **Fixes**
